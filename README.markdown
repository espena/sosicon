# Sosicon v 1.0
For Linux, OS X and Windows. Converts SOSI files to a number of other formats, including shapefile and
PostGIS database import files. The parser is still under development.

SOSI is a data format used for exchanging geographical information in Norway. The name is an acronym
for _"Samordnet Opplegg for Stedfestet Informasjon"_, which translates into something like
_"Coordinated Approach for Geospatial Information"_. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSI)
has more.

Contributors are most welcome!

## Online version
A working web version of Sosicon is now available on [app.sosicon.espenandersen.no](https://app.sosicon.espenandersen.no).
There's no need to install any binaries. Just run the conversion right in your browser.

The web application uses a WebAssembly version of Sosicon. The process runs on your local machine only.
No data are uploaded to the web server during the process.

As of now, the web version only supports Shapefile conversion. Memory restrictions may limit the maximum SOSI
file size to be successfully processed. In such case an error message will be displayed, advising you to use a
locally installed version of Sosicon instead.

## Features
*  Swift conversion
*  Selectable feature/objtype/field export
*  Supports command-line piping
*  Written in ANSI C++
*  Compiles and runs on OS X, Linux (32 and 64 bit) and Windows
*  Cross-platform GUI version built in [Qt](http://qt.io)

## Graphical user interface (GUI)
Desktop versions of sosicon for OSX and Windows are available for download from the bin directory:

* [DMG archive for OSX <= 10.11](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/blob/master/bin/gui/osx/sosicon_v1.0_osx.dmg?raw=true)
* [Installer for 32-bit Windows](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/blob/master/bin/gui/win/x86/sosicon_v1.0_gui_setup_x86.exe?raw=true)
* [Installer for 64-bit Windows](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/blob/master/bin/gui/win/x64/sosicon_v1.0_gui_setup_x64.exe?raw=true)

These versions of sosicon are built using the cross-platform development tool [Qt](http://qt.io),
licensed under the [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) open-source license. A copy of the source
code kan be obtained [here](http://sosicon.espenandersen.no/qt/single/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.6.0.tar.gz)
(OS X and Linux), and is also available from the vendorâ€™s web site.

## Command-line interface
Prebuilt Sosicon command-line binaries are located in the /bin directory of the repo. Choose your OS and put the
executable in a location where it can be run from the command line.

* [Linux 32-bit executable](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/blob/master/bin/cmd/linux32/sosicon?raw=true)
* [Linux 64-bit executable](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/blob/master/bin/cmd/linux64/sosicon?raw=true)
* [OS X executable](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/blob/master/bin/cmd/osx/sosicon?raw=true)
* [Windows executable](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/blob/master/bin/cmd/win/sosicon.exe?raw=true)

The Windows executable also requires
[Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784).

### Inspect file content
You can inspect the content of a SOSI file by using the -stat command, like this:

`sosicon -stat input.sos`

This command will render a list of SOSI elements (geometry types among other things) and SOSI
object types (OBJTYPE).

### Shapefile conversion

To convert a SOSI file to shape, run Sosicon from the directory where the SOSI file
resides. Use the -2shp parameter to emit the three required files: Shape file (shp), database
file (dbf) and index file (shx). A projection file (prj) will also be created if the
reference grid is recognized by Sosicon.

`sosicon -2shp input.sos`

On Linux and OS X, batch conversion is supported by piping:

`ls *.sos | sosicon -2shp`

On Windows, use `dir` with the `/b` switch for piping:

`dir *.sos /b | sosicon -2shp`

The above command will convert every *.sos file in current directory to corresponding shapefiles.
The files will be written to the same directory, keeping the file title extended with feature name,
geometry type and shp/shx/dbf extensions.

Use the -o parameter to specify optional output file basename:

`sosicon -2shp -o ~/myfolder/arealdekke input.sos`

### PostGIS conversion

Use the -2psql parameter to make a PostGIS import file (SQL script) from a SOSI file. The generated
SQL file can be run against any PostgreSQL database with PostGIS installed. Use the
[psql command-line utility](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/app-psql.html) to import the file.

`sosicon -2psql input.sos`

This command will create a default SQL file named "postgis_dump.sql". When imported to PostgreSQL, the
data tables will be put in the schema "sosicon" by default. There will be one table for each recognized
geometry in the SOSI file. The tables will be named "object_point", "object_polygon" and "object_linestring".

The "-schema" and "-table" parameters can be used to customize the schema and table base name:

`sosicon -2psql -schema topo -table arealdekke input.sos`

When imported to PostgreSQL, the tables will be named "arealdekke_point", "arealdekke_polygon" and
"arealdekke_linestring". The tables will be put in a schema named "topo".

By default, the SOSI geometries are converted to [EPSG:4326](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4623/)
grid when imported to PostgreSQL. Use the "-srid" parameter to specify another target grid, for example
Google mercator; SRID 900913:

`sosicon -2psql -schema topo -table arealdekke -srid 900913 input.sos`

PostGIS takes care of the actual grid conversion when the data is inserted into the table(s). The user
must assert that the target srid exists in PostGIS' spatial_ref_sys table.

## Build from source code

###Linux/OS X
You need g++ to compile Sosicon. To build the command-line version from source code, check out the git
repository, enter the src directory and run `make` and then `make install`. There's no `configure` yet.
On 32-bit Linux systems, the binaries will be output to [bin/cmd/linux32](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/cmd/linux32).
On 64-bit Linux systems, the binaries will be output to [bin/cmd/linux64](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/cmd/linux64).
On OS X, the binaries will be output in <em>[bin/cmd/osx](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/cmd/osx)</em>.

If you run `make install` after building the source, the executable will be copied to $INSTALL_PATH,
or default to `/usr/local/bin/sosicon`.

###Windows
Project files for Visual Studio is included in the repository. Open src/sosicon.sln solution
file in Visual Studio (Express) 2013 and build the project from there.

###GUI version
The source code for the GUI version is located in [gui/sosicon](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/gui/sosicon).
Download and install the community version of [Qt](http://qt.io) for your platform to open and build the project in Qt Creator.

## Development
Sosicon is still in beta. Shapefile and PostgreSQL export works reasonably well on most common SOSI geometry types, but there are still bugs.

## Source documentation
Documentation exists in html, rtf and pdf formats. See the doc directory within the repository or visit
[sosicon.espenandersen.no](http://sosicon.espenandersen.no/) for an online version.

The source code documentation for sosicon is generated by the brilliant [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
code documentation tool written by Dimitri van Heesch.

### Ragel parser
The parser in sosicon is based on the [Ragel state machine compiler](http://www.complang.org/ragel/).
The ragel script is located in the src/ragel directory. Ragel binaries for OS X, Linux 32- and 64-bit and
Win32 is precompiled and stored in /src/ragel/bin/. The makefile is set up to reference the correct binary
when compiling on Linux or OS X.

Ragel was designed and written by Adrian Thurston and released under the
[GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt) in 2002. Sosicon relies heavily
on the excellent work of Thurston and [his team of contributors](http://www.complang.org/ragel/CREDITS).
